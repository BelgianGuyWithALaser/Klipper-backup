# Klipper-backup
This is my personal klipper backup for my heavily modded cr20 pro.

Mods added to this printer are :

Linear rails kit XZ (BLV ender 3 kit)
Linear rails adapter Y (printermods)
Ruthex glassfiber reinforced belts on XY
Voron afterburner extruder (BMG internals + trianglelabs spider hotend)
trianglelabs pancake stepper for my extruder
50W heater cartridge
SKR1.4 Turbo with TMC2209's
Dual Z independant driven
Probably forgot to mention other things, but just to point out that it's not just copy / paste but check the settings for you're own and change them if needed.
